### Project Structure
### Usage

- **Data Preprocessing:** Run the data preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare the data.
  - [notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb](notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Perform EDA to understand the data and identify important features.
  - [notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb)

- **Model Training:** Train the machine learning model using the prepared dataset.
  - [notebooks/model_training.ipynb](notebooks/model_training.ipynb)

- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict heart disease risk on new data. Refer to `src/model.py` for prediction scripts.
